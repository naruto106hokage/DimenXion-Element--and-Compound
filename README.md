DimenXion Element and Compound - Birr Educational Platform Module
Overview
The Element and Compound Module is a specialized, interactive educational application developed in Unity for the Birr Educational Platform. It is designed to provide students with an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) experience to understand the foundational concepts of chemistry, specifically the structure and properties of elements and compounds.

This module is intended to be loaded and managed by the central DXT Master App (DXT_MA), ensuring seamless integration and navigation within the overall platform.

Key Features & Learning Objectives
3D Atomic Models: Features visually accurate and interactive 3D models of various atoms, allowing users to manipulate and explore their components (protons, neutrons, electrons).

Compound Formation Simulation: Allows users to virtually combine different elements to observe the formation of common chemical compounds and understand the rules of chemical bonding.

Interactive Quizzing: Includes embedded challenges and quizzes to test user comprehension on identifying elements, understanding valency, and naming simple compounds.

Immersive Learning: Utilizes the Unity environment to deliver complex scientific concepts through engaging, hands-on, and spatially aware interactions critical for AR/VR applications.

Performance Optimization: Designed for high performance on target AR/VR headsets, ensuring smooth frame rates and a stable learning environment.

Technologies Used
Platform: Unity Engine (C#)

Core Concepts: Chemical Modeling, 3D Graphics, Interactive UI/UX for VR/AR, State Management

Integration: Designed for dependency injection or dynamic loading via the DXT Master App's module manager.

Setup Instructions
Dependencies: This module requires the necessary VR/AR SDKs (e.g., Unity XR Interaction Toolkit, Meta XR SDK, or equivalent) to be imported into the Unity project.

Asset Integration: This project is intended to be a sub-module. It should be placed within the assets structure expected by the DXT Master App to ensure correct loading and scene transition management.

Build: Configure build settings for the desired VR/AR target (e.g., Android, Meta Quest) and build the package for deployment on the Birr Platform.
