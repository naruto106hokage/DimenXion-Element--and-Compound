Conditional approach(if.error):
1. Make sure that the bg_music audiosource must be main camera only.
2. If an error seems like “file name soundmanager is alreeady 	present”, replace one of the file.
3. If an error seems like “script_name does not contain a 	definition for ‘sm’”, do refactor with the correct name.
